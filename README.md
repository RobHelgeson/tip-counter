# Tip Counter

A simple, mobile-first web app for tracking tips from work. Enter dollar amounts, see a running total, and delete entries after journaling them.

Built for my daughter using [Claude](https://claude.ai) in about 10 minutes. Zero build tools — just three files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`) hosted on GitHub Pages.
